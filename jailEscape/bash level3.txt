We can't read the file with commands that contains letter : b,d,k,s or c

We will use tail

when running tail /home/level3/flag.txt we got nothing since the output is redirected to the variable assignement

We can't redirect to stderr since its being sent to /dev/null

We will send data to stdin instead so we can see then on the screen

tail /home/level3/flag.txt >&0

This cause an error around the >&0 when used inside backticks

We will put the expression inside a new eval $()

eval $(tail /home/level3.flag.txt >&0)
